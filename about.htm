		<h2>About HempLAN</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The first HempLAN, named after those that created it (it has absolutely nothing to do with marijuana), was held in the summer of 2004.</li>
			<li>LAN parties pre-dating the HempLAN name featured 16-man Xbox LANs. These LANs were held separately from HempLAN due to the fact that playing the Xbox was the main event (HempLAN was and is mostly geared towards computer games, with console being secondary).</li>
			<li>HempLAN has been a two-day, overnight event for every LAN party so far. This is variable, though; it really depends on the opinions of everyone.</li>
			<li>HempLAN does not make a profit. All money collected is used to pay for utilities and drinks, and any leftover is used to make things better for the next LAN party. In the past, the money leftover has been used to purchase new tables and power strips for the LAN.</li>
			<li>HempLAN is a private event. This means you must be allowed to come before coming. Generally, that means knowing someone who already attends, joining the <a href="http://www.hemplan.org/forum/">forums</a>, and asking if it would be alright if you came.</li>
			<li>Drink of choice is Mountain Dew, due to price and availability. Mello Yello is also acceptable. Energy drinks, such as Bawls, are often consumed as well.</li>
			<li>Mountain Dew LAN was freakin' awesome. Anyone who attended knows what I'm talking about.</li>
