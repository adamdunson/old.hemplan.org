				Disclaimer: This flash was made in a jiffy, therefore the quality is not up to par with the previous HempLAN flashes.<br />(Note to Opera users...apparently the flash has a bug where your mouse cursor disappears when you move it away from the flash. Try Alt+Tabbing or WinKey+D to make it appear again. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.)

		<h2>HempLAN 8.0...minigames?</h2>
		<div id="when"><i>When:</i> Friday, July 13 at 3:00 PM to Saturday, July 14</div>
		
		<h3>Important Pre-LAN:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure to have everything installed/working if possible. We've spent too much time in the past getting someone else's computers working because they were stupid.</li>
			<li>Please install <a href="http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&amp;catid=5">Daemon Tools</a> [daemon-tools.cc] (or other disc image mounting program) and learn to use it before coming. This will be used for many of the games and we don't want to have to teach you how to use it.</li>
			<li>You absolutely must have anti-virus software <strong>and</strong> anti-adware/spyware software installed. You must also run a thorough virus check before coming or before you connect to the network. (We would prefer that you run the adware/spyware scans as well.)

		<p class="note">We have ISOs/installs for all of the games, except for CS and DoD.</p>
		<p class="note">Steam account, including all games (DoD/CS/HL2 for mods) is required to play Steam games.</p>
		
		<h3>Most important stuff to bring:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>$10 fee. $5 goes to parents for utilities. $5 goes to miscellaneous LAN stuff. Anything left over from extension cords will go towards drinks for everyone.</li>
			<li>Ethernet cables, just in case ours aren't working. If you don't have one and I have to make one, you pay $5 rental cable fee.</li>
			<li>Powerstrip/UPS (If you don't bring a powerstrip, we won't promise any access to plugs.)</li>
			<li>Food, drinks, and money. We won't be providing food (unless there is leftover money) so expect to buy something or bring your own food.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Less important stuff to bring:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Computer, monitor, ethernet cord, keyboard, mouse (&amp; mousepad), Wii.</li>
			<li>Headset, Headphones, or Headphones and an external Mic (NO speakers)</li>
			<li>A fan, especially if you have an awesome fan like Jordan's, unless you want to sweat like a Wii remote through a TV.</li>
			<li>Small folding tables that can hold a computer (just in case we need an extra.)</li>
			<li>A computer chair is optional but recommended for a Wii-er.</li>
			<li>GCN controllers and Wii controllers, if you have them. If you have one, create your Mii and save it to a controller so you can copy yours over as 'traveling' on my Wii.</li>
			<li>Pillows (and sheets) for sleeping like a Wii (with super power-failing power).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Other Optional Costs:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bring money for food. You can expect that someone will make a run to a food place at some point. The awesome Mexican place is in limbo at the moment.</li>
			<li>Zyzy is taking orders for Bawls in 16oz cans. The cost is $2.00 a-piece. Contact him online if you want to order some.  Make sure you reach him before 12:00 Wednesday, or you will not be guaranteed what you asked for.</li>
			<li>Zyzy can make you custom length ethernet cords if you want one to keep. The price depends on the length, but it's significantly cheaper than in a store.</li>
			<li>For every $50, you get a free 56Kbps modem.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Other Notes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Please take time to make an account on our <a href="../forum/">Forum</a>. This is the best way to discuss LAN dates and games. You don't have to watch it daily, but this way we can discuss LAN stuff as a group.</li>
			<li>If you have any suggestions for games for this or future LANs, post them on the forum and we will add them to the list.</li>
			<li>We've removed Serious Sam since it's so monotonous.</li>
			<li>We've removed Iron Grip and Sourceforts until better versions are developed.</li>
