		<h2>HempLAAAAAAN 7.0!!</h2>
		<div id="when"><i>When:</i> Friday, March 16 at 3:00 PM to Saturday, March 17</div>
		
		<h3>Important Pre-LAN:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure to have everything installed/working if possible. We've spent too much time in the past getting someone else's computers working because they were stupid.</li>
			<li>Please install <a href="http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&amp;catid=5">Daemon Tools</a> [daemon-tools.cc] and learn to use it before coming. We can help you at the LAN, but we would rather not. This is a free utility for mounting optical disc images in a virtual DVD drive.</li>
			<li>You absolutely must have anti-virus software <strong>and</strong> anti-adware/spyware software installed. You must also run a thorough virus check before coming or before you connect to the network. (We would prefer that you run the adware/spyware scans as well.)

				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Main Games:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Day of Defeat: Source</li>
			<li>Counter-Strike: Source</li>
			<li>Serious Sam: 1st Encounter</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.warsow.net/?page=download">Warsow</a> [warsow.net]</li>
			<li><a href="http://armagetronad.net/downloads.php">LAHt BIKes (Armagetron)</a> [armagetronad.net]</li>
			<li>Super Smash Brothers Melee (GCN)</li>
			<li>WiiSports (Wii)</li>
			<li>WarioWare: Smooth Moves (Wii)</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="note">Squee has set up a server for running many of the games. <a href="HempLAN7-server.htm">Click here</a> to view the server's information.</p>
		
		<h3>Other Games:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.isotx.com/index.php?topic=2099">Iron Grip (HL2 mod)</a> [isotx.com]</li>
			<li><a href="http://halflife2.filefront.com/file/Goldeneye_Source;53591#Download">Goldeneye Source (HL2 Mod)</a> [filefront.com]</li>
			<li><a href="http://cultris.ath.cx/external/cultris/index.asp">Cultris (VS tetris)</a> [ath.cx]</li>
			<li>Company of Heroes</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="note">We have ISOs/installs for all of the games, except for CS and DoD.</p>
		<p class="note">Steam account, including all games (DoD/CS/HL2 for mods) is required to play.</p>
		
		<h3>Most important stuff to bring:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>$10 fee. $5 goes to parents for utilities. $5 goes to extension cords. Anything left over from extension cords will go towards drinks for everyone.</li>
			<li>Ethernet cables, just in case ours aren't working. If you don't have one and I have to make one, you pay $5 rental cable fee.</li>
			<li>Powerstrip/UPS (If you don't bring a powerstrip, we won't promise any access to plugs.)</li>
			<li>Food, drinks, and money. We won't be providing food or drinks (unless there is leftover money) so expect to buy something or bring your own food.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Less important stuff to bring:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Computer, monitor, ethernet cord, keyboard, mouse (&amp; mousepad), Spartan warrior drink.</li>
			<li>Headset, Headphones, or Headphones and an external Mic (NO speakers)</li>
			<li>A fan, especially if you have an awesome fan like Jordan's, unless you want to sweat like a Spartan warrior in heat.</li>
			<li>Small folding tables that can hold a computer (just in case we need an extra.)</li>
			<li>A computer chair is optional but recommended for a Spartan warrior.</li>
			<li>GCN controllers and Wii, if you have them. We don't have any working ones left. Seriously.</li>
			<li>Pillows (and sheets) for <a href="hemplan7-easteregg.htm" class="easteregg">sleeping</a> like a Spartan warrior.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class="note">There will be an extra computer set up for anyone who wants to play. You will still need to provide a steam account and games, but the PC is capable of running Source games with a playable framerate (at lowest settings with 800x600 resolution).</p>
		
		<h3>Other Optional Costs:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>We will make at least one run to the awesome Mexican place. The cost is about $6.50 for the awesome burritos.</li>
			<li>Zyzy is taking orders for Bawls in 16oz cans. The cost is $2.00 a-piece. Give me a number. If you can somehow pay me before-hand, I can guarantee I will have enough for you.</li>
			<li>Zyzy can make you custom length ethernet cords if you want one to keep. The price depends on the length, but it's significantly cheaper than in a store.</li>
			<li>For every $50, you get a free 56Kbps modem.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Other Notes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Serious Sam: First Encounter is completely different and better than Second Encounter.</li>
			<li>If anyone else can suggest any more games, we might try them.</li>
			<li>I removed SourceForts from games for now. We may try it again when SourceForts 2 comes out.</li>
			<li>No alcohol (yes, I know it's St. Patrick's day on Saturday, but no).</li>
		</ul>
