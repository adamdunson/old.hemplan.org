				<td colspan="2">The <a href="gallery/">Gallery</a> has been updated and fixed (finally, omg). Zyzy and I decided to chug through it today, meaning he and I resized, renamed, and sorted through the photographs from past and recent LANs. The <a href="gallery/">Gallery</a> is now setup with tables, so it looks better and a little more organized. Oh, and thanks to Zyzy for creating the better thumbnails (actually cropped, not just resized).<br /><br />
				HempLAN 9.0 went pretty well. We had a lot that attended, which is really great. I feel like it could have been a little more organized, but it was an improvement over 8.0 for sure. Please make sure you head over to the <a href="forum/">Forum</a> and join the discussion about the next HempLAN! The more input we get, the better it will be.<br /><br />
				Oh, and happy 2008 everybody.</td>

Go to the <a href="forum/">forum</a> to post dates and to get information (or contribute to the getting of information).

Also, we should discuss the dates earlier so as to give everyone time to set the date on their calendars (since last time, the timing was a little weird).<br /><br />Most everyone is back to school/college so good luck everyone and hope to continue keeping up with all of you on the forum. Also, check the links page for a link to Garbanzo's website.</td>

We mostly played WarioWare and Wii Sports and ate awesome Filipino food. We ended up watching Team America around midnight (when most everyone was gone) and then we went to sleep. Not sure if this party can qualify as being a HempLAN, but we do have some photographs from this that Zyzy took that I will probably be uploading sometime (that is, whenever I get the pictures).</td>
